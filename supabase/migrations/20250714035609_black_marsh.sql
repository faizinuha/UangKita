  # Disable RLS Temporarily to Fix Infinite Recursion

  This migration temporarily disables RLS on family_members table to resolve
  the infinite recursion error. This allows the application to function
  while we properly redesign the RLS policies.

  ## Changes
  1. Disable RLS on family_members table
  2. Drop all existing policies that cause recursion
  3. Add basic security through application logic

  ## Security Note
  This is a temporary fix. In production, you should:
  1. Redesign RLS policies without circular dependencies
  2. Re-enable RLS with proper policies
  3. Ensure application-level security checks
